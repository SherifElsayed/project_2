A 2D square cavity with a width and height of Lx = Ly = 1 m with three stationary walls
with no-slip conditions and one moving wall, on top, with a tangential velocity of 1 m/s.
Neumann boundary conditions are assumed for pressure on all the walls, 𝜕𝑃𝜕𝑛=0.
The fluid inside the cavity is viscous and incompressible.
The MAC method is implemented using c++ on a staggered grid.
Re = 100, timestep of 0.01, and grid size = 100x100.
